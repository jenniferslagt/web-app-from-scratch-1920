# Single page app - The waves and the chance on sunburning



## Description 
I made a single page app for surfers in which I used the Dark Sky API. This allows them to take a look at the current weather of their location. In this way, they can check the waves (based on the wind) and if it's necessary to project yourself against the sun. 

## Used data
I'll request the next data (from the Dark Sky API) to make this possible:
Windspeed: The wind speed in miles per hour.
Wind bearing: The direction that the wind is coming from in degrees, with true north at 0° and progressing clockwise. (If windSpeed is zero, then this value will not be defined.)
Temperature: The temperature in degree Celsius or Fahrenheit.
